What is Cahoots?
----------------

Cahoots is software that attempts to categorize snippets of text into one of several categories. It runs a series of parsers, and returns a list of potential datatypes and interpretations with confidence values. In short, it attempts to "comprehend" the snippet you provide.

Its ideal use is within a daemon or service with a long life/execution time. It can also be run as a standalone Cahoots server (detailed `here <https://github.com/SerenitySoftwareLLC/cahoots/wiki/Cahoots-Server-Setup>`_).

What is Cahoots NOT?
--------------------

Cahoots is not meant for diagramming and mining large sets of text. While a text mining engine could utilize Cahoots in order to target specific snippets that it mined out of a large set of text, Cahoots is not meant to mine text.

Cahoots is not software that you would integrate into a non-daemon web app that would bootstrap and instantiate it on every page view. The bootstrap process can be somewhat intensive and should only run once (during an application's launch process).

Basic Module Usage
------------------
::

    >>> from cahoots.parser import CahootsParser
    >>> cahoots = CahootsParser(bootstrap=True)
    >>> results = cahoots.parse('http://www.google.com/')
    >>> results
    {

        'top': <cahoots.result.ParseResult object>,
        'results': {
            'count': 1,
            'matches': [
                <cahoots.result.ParseResult object>
            ],
            'types': [
